# Evolution #2 Data Management

## What do you know?:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data management is one of the pillars/evolutions I feel the most confident in my knowledge of. The data management process at its purest base is focused around, cleaning, normalizing, storing, updating and retrieving data. One of the biggest factors in being adept at data management, similar to analytics, is a strong working knowledge of the business and the related data that will be managed.  While there are a few different programs that can be used to complete this work, the one I am most comfortable with is SQL. Which stands for structured query language which is used for relational databases. To explain this means that the information stored in this database is stored in multiple tables that all have various levels of relationships with each other. Each table is specific to one ‘area’ of data, like customers, orders, or products. Each table has a primary key which is a unique identifier for each table which is used to identify the specific record of a table. For example, a customers table may have a customer ID number as the primary key, this ID is unique for each individual customer and makes it quick and easy to identify specific customers. Another use of primary keys outside of being a unique identifier is that they can be used to establish and identify relationships between tables. Primary keys can be listed under other tables where they are not the primary key as foreign keys, again this helps establish a relationship between the two tables but then can be used to identify how/where values in one table line up with another. To bring back the customer table/customer ID example, if that same database had an orders table, customer ID would be the field to use as a foreign key in the orders table just as the Order ID from the orders table would be used as a foreign key in the customer table. There are multiple ways to demonstrate and show these relationships within the non relational database model, including one to one, one to many, and then many to many. It is important to understand the database you are trying to create and manage as that allows you to best structure your SQL database. These structures can be seen further in the crows feet diagram attached in this repository, this diagram shows each table, their keys and the relationship between each table.

## Where are you weak?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My biggest weakness is NO SQL databases, including MongoDB. While I am aware why they are used, for non-relational databases, I am not familiar with that actual structure or how to manage these types of databases. I see this as an enormous opportunity for my skill set, as it is unrealistic to assume every database will be relational. This is certainly an aspect I want to fold into some degree in my final project in order to get more first-hand experience. 

## What don’t you know?:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My biggest blindspot would be other database structures outside of SQL and NOSQL databases. From my initial research I cannot see a situation that would not be covered by either the relational database (SQL) model or the NOSQL model, however there have to be some specific type databases that do not follow under either model. Additionally I would love to learn more about managing extremely large databases in large organizations with lots of users to monitor and high volumes of different types of data to manage.    

## Integration with the other 3 evolutions:
### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evolution #1: Data Analytics:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting with analytics, in the vast majority of situations any data that will be analyzed will first be stored and organized within some  form of database local to the organization. In order to make analysis easier and more efficient it is important that data is accessible, organized and uniform. This not only helps in terms of ease, but also helps lead to more accurate analysis which in turn would lead to a higher level of organizational success. Individuals conducting analysis can use the data management software itself (like MYSQL) to pull the appropriate data they need to look at or there are even opportunities to have integration between the analytical system and the database. This allows the analytical system, like Tableau for instance, to pull the data from the databases automatically and then allow the user to use Tableau’s interface to conduct analysis quicker than if the individual had to pull data themselves.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evolution #3: Software and Systems:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data management interacts with software systems in a myriad of ways. First off, the obvious need for data management software but it goes far past that, including the example above with a data analysis program pulling from databases automatically. Also included in this relationship would be any software that collects data and then feeds into the database for storage. An example of this would be order or transaction management software, this software would be used to execute customer transactions while also sending transaction and customer data to appropriate databases. This is just one example of how these two evolutions interact and there are limitless possibilities for other interactions. In general, most software systems will feed into a database of somesort, there are few interactions in the business world that do not feature some form of record that feeds to a database.
